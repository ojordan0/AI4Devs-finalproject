# Work tickets

**Assisted Shopping Platform: ComproParaTi** · **Version:** 1.18 · **Date:** November 12, 2026

Part of the project documentation ([readme](../readme.md)). IDs (`BR`, `FR`, `E`, `US`, `AC`) are defined in the [PRD](01-PRD.md).

---

## 1. How tickets work

- **Scope:** these tickets cover milestone 1 ([PRD §8.1](01-PRD.md#81-milestone-1-core-cycle-end-to-end)). Milestone 2 tickets are written when milestone 1 is delivered.
- **Rules live in the PRD.** A ticket says what to build and which requirements, rules, and acceptance criteria it covers. It does not restate them.
- **Epic and stories:** each ticket belongs to one epic and implements one or more user stories ([PRD §14](01-PRD.md#14-epics-and-user-stories)). The first story listed is the ticket's main story. Tickets with no story are foundation work in E-08.
- **Delivery** is the course deadline the ticket must meet: D2 or D3 ([PRD §8.1](01-PRD.md#81-milestone-1-core-cycle-end-to-end)).
- **Size:** S (up to half a day), M (one to two days), L (three to five days).
- **Spec first:** each ticket except design tickets (below) is built as one OpenSpec change, named like its branch without the type prefix (branch `feat/t-07-groups-api`, change `t-07-groups-api`). The change is generated from the ticket and the documents it references; its proposal links the ticket's issue, its requirements cite the PRD IDs instead of copying rule text, and each scenario is named after the acceptance criterion it verifies, for example `AC-59`. A ticket without acceptance criterion IDs names its scenarios as described in [Security and testing §2.6](07-SECURITY-AND-TESTING.md#26-coverage-targets). The change is reviewed before implementation, and archived in the ticket's pull request as its last commit before the merge. If the documents leave a question open, they are updated first.
- **Branching:** one branch and one pull request per ticket, merged into `main`. The branch is named `<type>/t-<NN>-<slug>`, after the ticket ID, where `<type>` is `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, or `refactor`; for example `feat/t-07-groups-api`. Each ticket's branch name is in the [ticket overview](#3-ticket-overview).
- **Work outside a ticket** happens only when agreed with the project owner, on a branch named `<type>/<slug>`, through a pull request, and without an OpenSpec change.
- **Design tickets** (type Design) restyle screens that are already built to [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) and the Stitch screens in `design/stitch/`, and change no behavior. They have no OpenSpec change. Before work starts, the screens in scope are summarized and approved. A design ticket depends on the tickets that build its screens. If the work needs a behavior change, that change is a separate ticket with an OpenSpec change. The pull request says how each "Done when" condition was checked.
- **Course deliveries:** at each deadline, the state of `main` is pushed to the delivery branch: `feature/entrega-1-OJE` for D1, `feature/entrega-2-OJE` for D2, and `final-project-OJE` for D3.

**Definition of done** for every ticket:

1. The ticket's OpenSpec change was reviewed before implementation, and is archived in the pull request before the merge. Design tickets have no OpenSpec change ([above](#1-how-tickets-work)).
2. The listed acceptance criteria have automated tests named with their IDs. A ticket without acceptance criterion IDs has each of its conditions verified instead ([Security and testing §2.6](07-SECURITY-AND-TESTING.md#26-coverage-targets)). All tests pass in CI.
3. Linting and type checks pass, and the generated OpenAPI document is up to date.
4. Interface text comes from the translation files, in Spanish and English.
5. Any change in behavior or design is reflected in the document that owns it.
6. The work session is recorded in [prompts.md](../prompts.md).
7. The pull request passes the adversarial review ([CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#branches-commits-and-prs)) and is merged to `main`.

## 2. Tracking in GitHub

User stories and tickets are tracked as issues in the project's repository, [ojordan0/AI4Devs-finalproject](https://github.com/ojordan0/AI4Devs-finalproject/issues), and moved across a board in a GitHub Project linked to the repository. GitHub Issues keeps the work next to the code: issues link to branches and pull requests, and merging a pull request closes its ticket. Only features available on a personal account are used.

| Item | How it is tracked |
| --- | --- |
| User story | An issue titled with its ID and story, for example "US-10 Add an item by typing only its name", labeled `story` and `m1`, `m2`, or both, for the milestones of its acceptance criteria. All 26 stories have an issue, including those only in milestone 2. |
| Work ticket | An issue titled with its ID and title, labeled `task`, and added as a sub-issue of its main story. Its description lists any other stories it implements. Tickets with no story have no parent. |
| Epic | Not tracked in GitHub. Epics are defined in [PRD §14.1](01-PRD.md#141-epics). |
| Delivery | A GitHub milestone for each course delivery (D1, D2, and D3) and for milestone 2 (M2), due on the dates in [PRD §8](01-PRD.md#8-release-plan-and-launch-criteria). Each ticket is assigned to its delivery. |
| Board | A GitHub Project, [ComproParaTi](https://github.com/users/ojordan0/projects/1), linked to the repository and holding the tickets, in the board layout with its default columns: Todo, In Progress, and Done. A ticket moves to In Progress when its branch is created, and to Done when its issue is closed. |
| Pull request | One per ticket ([section 1](#1-how-tickets-work)). Its description includes `Closes #<issue>`, so merging it closes the ticket. |

Issue descriptions contain the goal, the related stories, and the acceptance criteria IDs, and link back to this document. The scope and the rules stay here and in the PRD. The labels, milestones, issues, sub-issue links, and project are created from these documents by [`scripts/setup-github-issues.py`](../scripts/setup-github-issues.py), which can be run again without creating duplicates.

**Story issues.** Each story's text, requirements, and acceptance criteria are in [PRD §14.2](01-PRD.md#142-user-stories). Each ticket's issue is in the [ticket overview](#3-ticket-overview).

## 4. Tickets

### T-01 Repository, project scaffold, and CI

**Epic:** E-08 · **Stories:** None · **Type:** DevOps · **Increment:** 1 · **Delivery:** D2 · **Size:** M · **Depends on:** none

**Goal:** a repository where any developer can clone, run one command, and work, with every pull request checked automatically.

**Scope:**

- Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript in strict mode, following the project structure in [Architecture §2](03-ARCHITECTURE.md#2-project-structure).
- Milestone 1 packages from [Architecture §1.6](03-ARCHITECTURE.md#16-dependencies); package manager npm.
- ESLint and Prettier; Vitest with the coverage report, and Playwright with Chromium and WebKit, each with one passing example test ([Security and testing §2](07-SECURITY-AND-TESTING.md#2-testing-strategy)).
- `docker-compose.yml` with Postgres; `.env.example` with every variable in [Infrastructure §7](06-INFRASTRUCTURE.md#7-configuration).
- npm scripts: `setup`, `dev`, `lint`, `db:migrate`, `db:seed`, and the test commands in [Security and testing §2.5](07-SECURITY-AND-TESTING.md#25-running-tests-locally-and-in-ci).
- GitHub Actions workflow running the checks in [Infrastructure §3](06-INFRASTRUCTURE.md#3-deployment-process), step 2, including the documentation link check and the dependency audit. T-03 adds the OpenAPI check.
- Dependabot pull requests for npm packages and GitHub Actions ([Security and testing §1](07-SECURITY-AND-TESTING.md#1-security)).
- Branch protection on `main`, as described in [Infrastructure §3](06-INFRASTRUCTURE.md#3-deployment-process), step 3: a pull request and passing checks are required, with no approvals and no bypass for administrators.
- Claude Code hooks for the checks, configured in `.claude/settings.json` with their scripts in `.claude/hooks/`, next to the branch-protection hook:
  - before `gh pr create`, run `npm run lint`, the type check (`tsc --noEmit`), and `npm test`, and block the pull request with the errors when any of them fails;
  - after Claude edits or writes a file, run ESLint on that file and show Claude the errors.
- The application is added around the documentation already in the repository: `readme.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `prompts.md`, `docs/`, and `scripts/`.

**Done when:** a fresh clone runs `npm run setup`, `npm run dev`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:e2e` without errors, a pull request shows all checks, and Claude Code can't open a pull request while linting, type checks, or tests fail.

### T-02 Database schema, migrations, and seed data

**Epic:** E-08 · **Stories:** None · **Type:** Database · **Increment:** 1 · **Delivery:** D2 · **Size:** L · **Depends on:** T-01

**Goal:** the complete data model in Postgres, versioned with migrations, with seed data that covers every status and permission case.

**Scope:**

- Drizzle schema for every table, enumeration, constraint, and index in [Data model §2](04-DATA-MODEL.md#2-entities). Milestone 2 tables (`job_runs`) are included now, so later increments add no structural migrations.
- Check constraints, as [Data model §2](04-DATA-MODEL.md#2-entities) lists them: quantity range, a buyer exactly when the status isn't pending, shipment present only when shipped, a note when unavailable, link scheme, phone number format, and country format.
- Partial unique index: at most one default delivery address per group.
- First migration generated with drizzle-kit and applied by `npm run db:migrate`.
- Seed script loading the data in [Data model §3](04-DATA-MODEL.md#3-seed-data), safe to run again.
- A check in the CI workflow that the migrations match the schema ([Infrastructure §3](06-INFRASTRUCTURE.md#3-deployment-process), step 2).

**Acceptance criteria:** integration tests prove that each constraint rejects invalid data, and that the seed loads into an empty database.

**Done when:** `npm run setup` creates the database from scratch with seed data, and the tests pass in CI against a Postgres service container.

### T-03 API foundation and baseline security

**Epic:** E-08 · **Stories:** US-26 · **Type:** Backend · **Increment:** 1 · **Delivery:** D2 · **Size:** M · **Depends on:** T-02

**Goal:** the shared building blocks every endpoint uses, so later tickets only add business logic.

**Scope:**

- Route handler structure under `/api/v1` and the error format in [API §1](05-API.md#1-conventions).
- Request validation with Zod schemas shared with the interface, enforcing BR-32.
- Authorization guard that resolves the user's membership in the group that owns the data (BR-12), returning the same "not available" response for missing and inaccessible resources (BR-13).
- Origin check for requests that change data, rate limiter, and security headers ([Security and testing §1](07-SECURITY-AND-TESTING.md#1-security)).
- OpenAPI generation into `docs/openapi.yaml`, checked in CI.

**Acceptance criteria:** AC-97.

### T-04 Sign-in, onboarding, and basic profile

**Epic:** E-01 · **Stories:** US-01, US-02 · **Type:** Full stack · **Increment:** 1 · **Delivery:** D2 · **Size:** L · **Depends on:** T-03

**Goal:** a new user signs in with Google, completes onboarding, and lands in the app.

**Scope:**

- Better Auth with the Google provider, the Drizzle adapter, and database sessions (FR-01, BR-02, BR-03).
- Development-only sign-in by email, as a seed user or a new user ([Architecture §3](03-ARCHITECTURE.md#3-technical-decisions)).
- Welcome and "One last step" screens (FR-02, FR-03), with WhatsApp validation (BR-04). Completing onboarding runs getting started from T-07, so the user gets their group and first list (BR-06).
- Profile: language, WhatsApp number, email setting, and sign out (FR-04, without account deletion).
- What these screens need from the interface foundation: page translations choosing the language from the user, the Welcome choice, or the browser (FR-37); Tailwind CSS with the design tokens ([DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md)); and the shadcn/ui components the screens use.
- A placeholder at the Lists address, where a new user lands until T-10 builds Lists.

**Acceptance criteria:** AC-02, AC-03, AC-04, AC-05, AC-06, AC-98.

### T-05 App shell, navigation, and translations

**Epic:** E-08 · **Stories:** US-25, US-07 · **Type:** Frontend · **Increment:** 1 · **Delivery:** D2 · **Size:** M · **Depends on:** T-04

**Goal:** the frame every screen lives in, in both languages.

**Scope:**

- Bottom navigation and header with group selector and Refresh ([UX design §2.2](02-UX-DESIGN.md#22-navigation)), showing only the tabs the user's memberships allow (FR-08).
- Date and number formatting by language (FR-38), on the translation setup from T-04 (FR-37).
- The shadcn/ui components the shell needs, on the Tailwind CSS setup from T-04.
- Shared components for the design principles, empty states, loading, and errors ([UX design §2.1](02-UX-DESIGN.md#21-design-principles), [§2.7](02-UX-DESIGN.md#27-empty-states-loading-and-errors)).
- Mobile-first layout from 360 px wide, with a desktop layout.

**Acceptance criteria:** AC-99.

**Done when:** the shell renders in both languages on a phone-size screen with no accessibility violations reported by the automated checks.

### T-06 Production deployment

**Epic:** E-08 · **Stories:** None · **Type:** DevOps · **Increment:** 1 · **Delivery:** D3 · **Size:** M · **Depends on:** T-04

**Goal:** the app live on a public URL, deploying automatically from `main`.

**Scope:**

- Vercel project linked to the repository, Neon production database, and Google OAuth production client.
- Environment variables set in Vercel ([Infrastructure §7](06-INFRASTRUCTURE.md#7-configuration)).
- Build command that applies migrations before building ([Infrastructure §3](06-INFRASTRUCTURE.md#3-deployment-process)).
- Setup checklist in the repository for the manual steps.

**Done when:** merging to `main` deploys, and a person can sign in with Google on the public URL.

### T-07 Groups, memberships, and access

**Epic:** E-02 · **Stories:** US-07, US-01, US-04 · **Type:** Backend · **Increment:** 2 · **Delivery:** D2 · **Size:** M · **Depends on:** T-03

**Goal:** every user belongs to the right groups, and can reach only their data.

**Scope:**

- Getting started: a new user without an invitation gets a group and a first list (BR-06).
- `GET /me`, `GET /groups`, `GET /groups/{groupId}` ([API §2](05-API.md#2-endpoints)).
- Permission tests across two groups using the seed data.

**Acceptance criteria:** AC-01, AC-24, AC-26.

### T-08 Buyer invitations

**Epic:** E-02 · **Stories:** US-04 · **Type:** Full stack · **Increment:** 2 · **Delivery:** D3 · **Size:** L · **Depends on:** T-07, T-05

**Goal:** a member invites a buyer with a link sent on WhatsApp, and the buyer joins.

**Scope:**

- Create, list, and cancel invitations, and the preview and accept endpoints, for the buyer type (FR-06, BR-08, BR-09). A user who signs up through an invitation skips getting started (BR-06).

### T-19 Tests that survive a restyle

**Epic:** E-08 · **Stories:** None · **Type:** Design · **Increment:** all of milestone 1 · **Delivery:** D2 · **Size:** S · **Depends on:** none

**Goal:** the tests check behavior rather than markup or styling, so the design tickets can change how screens look without breaking tests that still hold.

**Scope:**

- Review the unit and browser tests for checks that depend on markup, class names, or styling. Change them to find elements by role, label, or translated text.
- The AC-95 browser test checks the notes element for injected markup, instead of counting every `b`, `img`, and `script` in the main area, which a restyle can add.
- Keep the layout checks that come from [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md): sidebar width, content width, and no sideways scroll at 360 px. The restyle has to keep these rules.
- Run the automated accessibility checks on every screen built so far in each of its main states, such as each item status, so a token that fails contrast also fails a test. Screens built later get their checks in their own tickets and in T-17.

**Done when:** no test depends on markup or styling that a restyle may change, and all tests pass.

- The app shell in `src/components/app-shell` (header, group selector, Refresh, and navigation) and the status chip, which appear on every screen ([DESIGN.md, Navigation](../DESIGN.md#navigation) and [Status Chips](../DESIGN.md#status-chips)).

**Done when:** the theme, the components, the app shell, and the status chip follow DESIGN.md, and all tests pass.
