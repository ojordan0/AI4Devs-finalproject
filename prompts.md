## Sessions

The project is planned and built in conversations with Claude, called parts, numbered in order across both phases. Prompt labels such as "Part 3, turn 12" refer to these tables.

### Planning

The documentation was planned in four conversations.

| Part | Name | Model | Full conversation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Build

Build sessions start with delivery 2. Each one lists the work tickets it covers, or "—" for work outside a ticket.

| Part | Ticket | Name | Tool | Model | Full conversation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Part 5 | — | OpenSpec setup: configuration, the verify workflow, and the pull request into `main` | Claude Code | Claude Opus 5.5 | [part-5-openspec-setup.md](docs/ai-conversations/part-5-openspec-setup.md) |
| Part 6 | — | UI design setup: review of the Stitch screens, the design system, and the GitHub CLI | Claude Code | Claude Opus 5.5 | [part-6-ui-design-setup.md](docs/ai-conversations/part-6-ui-design-setup.md) |
| Part 7 | — | Branch protection and review: the product brief, the branch-protection hook, the reviewer subagent, and pull request #46 | Claude Code | Claude Opus 5.5 | [part-7-branch-protection-and-review.md](docs/ai-conversations/part-7-branch-protection-and-review.md) |
| Part 8 | — | Design review fixes: resolving the adversarial review of pull request #47, and where new and invited users land | Claude Code | Claude Opus 5.5 | [part-8-design-review-fixes.md](docs/ai-conversations/part-8-design-review-fixes.md) |
| Part 9 | T-01 | Project scaffold: the application, local setup, CI, quality hooks, and pull request #48 | Claude Code | Claude Opus 5.5 | [part-9-project-scaffold.md](docs/ai-conversations/part-9-project-scaffold.md) |
| Part 10 | T-02 | Database schema: the tables and their rules, the first migration, seed data, constraint tests, the CI migration check, and pull request #49 | Claude Code | Claude Opus 5.5 | [part-10-database-schema.md](docs/ai-conversations/part-10-database-schema.md) |

| Part 12 | — | D2 scope: removing the launch-country access risk, fitting D2 and D3 to the available hours, and pull request #52 | Claude Code | Claude Opus 5.5 | [part-12-d2-scope.md](docs/ai-conversations/part-12-d2-scope.md) |
| Part 13 | T-03 | API foundation: the route wrapper, field limits, membership check, rate limits, security headers, the generated OpenAPI document, and pull request #53 | Claude Code | Claude Opus 5.5 | [part-13-api-foundation.md](docs/ai-conversations/part-13-api-foundation.md) |
| Part 14 | T-07 | Groups API: getting started, the current user and their tabs, the group endpoints, permission tests across groups, and pull request #54, built end to end from one prompt | Claude Code | Claude Opus 5.5 | [part-14-groups-api.md](docs/ai-conversations/part-14-groups-api.md) |

## Tools and phases

| Phase | Tool | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery and specification | Claude Desktop for Mac, in a Claude Project | The Project keeps every planning session and its context (documents, session summaries, and conversation exports) together. Claude turned the initial idea into a specification, answered open questions, and simplified the scope to an MVP (parts 1 and 2). |
| Second opinion | ChatGPT | Wrote an alternative specification, used only as a reference to find features Claude's specification had missed. |
| Product requirements, architecture, and planning | Claude Desktop for Mac, in a Claude Project | Wrote and refined the PRD and the technical documents, checked current facts on the web, proposed options for each decision, and kept the documents consistent (parts 3 and 4). |
| Product's name screening | Claude in Chrome | Searched US trademarks at tmsearch.uspto.gov for the name finalists. |
| Work tracking | Claude, with the GitHub CLI | Wrote [`scripts/setup-github-issues.py`](scripts/setup-github-issues.py), which creates the GitHub issues for every user story and ticket from the documents. |
| Interface design | Google Stitch, reviewed with Claude Code | Stitch generated the screen mockups and a first design system. Claude compared them with the PRD and the UX design, wrote feedback for Stitch screen by screen, and consolidated the design system into [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md), with the mockups kept as a visual reference in `design/stitch/` (part 6). |
| Build | Claude Code with OpenSpec | Spec-driven development, one OpenSpec change per work ticket ([Architecture §3](docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md#3-technical-decisions)). Starts with delivery 2. |

## Models

| Model | Where | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Sonnet 5.5 | Part 1. Discovery and initial project definition. | Fast iteration while the idea was still taking shape and the specification was rewritten often. |
| ChatGPT GPT-5.6 Sol | Parts 1 and 2. Generate alternative specification. | Contrast results with a completely different model. Get a different perspective on the solution. |
| Claude Fable 5.1 | Part 2, first half. Specification refinements. | Comparing two specifications and simplifying the MVP. |
| Claude Opus 5.5 | End of part 2, parts 3 and 4. Specification to PRD. | Complex reasoning across many linked documents: keeping rules, IDs, and decisions consistent, and catching gaps, such as an authentication library entering maintenance mode. |

## Rules and skills

**Rules** created during planning. They live in the repository, so they apply to every session and to Claude Code:

| Rule set | Where it lives | What it covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Documentation rules | [PRD, "How to read this document"](docs/01-PRD.md#how-to-read-this-document) and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | Each rule, number, and limit appears once, and other places refer to it by ID or link. IDs are defined only in the PRD. Documents are in English, contain no notes to the author or references to earlier versions, and carry their version in the header, not the file name. |
| Documentation checks | [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), and in CI ([Infrastructure §3](docs/06-INFRASTRUCTURE.md#3-deployment-process)) | After every change, every link, anchor, and ID must resolve, the Mermaid diagrams must parse, and the OpenAPI definition must validate. |
| Naming conventions | [Work tickets §1 and §2](docs/08-WORK-TICKETS.md#1-how-tickets-work), [PRD](docs/01-PRD.md#how-to-read-this-document) for IDs, [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for tests | ID prefixes (`BR`, `FR`, `E`, `US`, `AC`, `T`); numbered documents (`01-PRD.md` to `08-WORK-TICKETS.md`); ticket branches named after the ticket with a type prefix (`feat/t-07-groups-api`); course delivery branches (`feature/entrega-1-OJE`, `feature/entrega-2-OJE`, `final-project-OJE`); OpenSpec changes named like their branch without the prefix (`t-07-groups-api`); GitHub issues titled with their ID; tests named after their acceptance criterion (`AC-59`). |
| Agent rules | [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | Which document to read for each kind of task, the documents as the source of truth, layering, text only from translation files, only listed dependencies, and recording prompts here. |
| Spec first | [Work tickets §1](docs/08-WORK-TICKETS.md#1-how-tickets-work) and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), applied to every OpenSpec artifact by [`openspec/config.yaml`](openspec/config.yaml) | Each work ticket becomes one OpenSpec change, reviewed before implementation; requirements cite PRD IDs, and scenarios are named after acceptance criteria. |
| Definition of done | [Work tickets §1](docs/08-WORK-TICKETS.md#1-how-tickets-work) | What every ticket needs before it is merged. |
| Branches, commits, and pull requests | [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), enforced by [`.claude/hooks/protect-branches.py`](.claude/hooks/protect-branches.py) | One branch and pull request per ticket, a commit per request, the pull request and review steps, and course deliveries. The hook blocks commits on protected branches, pushes to `main`, force pushes, and GitHub writes that bypass a pull request (part 7). |
| Quality checks | [`.claude/hooks/check-before-pr.py`](.claude/hooks/check-before-pr.py) and [`.claude/hooks/lint-edited-file.py`](.claude/hooks/lint-edited-file.py), configured in [`.claude/settings.json`](.claude/settings.json) | Claude Code can't open a pull request while linting, type checks, or tests fail, and sees ESLint errors after each edit (T-01). |

**Skills and subagents** used in Claude:

| Skill | Source | Parts | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| engineering:system-design | Engineering plugin, by Anthropic | 1 to 3 | Designs systems, services, and architectures, including API design, data modeling, and service boundaries. Used to shape the architecture, the data model, and the API. |
| engineering:architecture | Engineering plugin, by Anthropic | 1 to 3 | Creates and evaluates architecture decision records: technology choices with their trade-offs and consequences. Used for the stack and the technical decisions in [Architecture §3](docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md#3-technical-decisions). |
| file-reading | Built into claude.ai, by Anthropic | 4 | Chooses how to read an uploaded file by its type. Used to list and open the documentation archive. |
| engineering:testing-strategy | Engineering plugin, by Anthropic | 4 | Designs test strategies and plans: the testing pyramid, coverage targets, and example test cases. Used to review the testing approach, find its gaps (sign-in in tests, test data isolation, outside services and time, local commands, coverage targets), and write the testing strategy in [Security and testing §2](docs/07-SECURITY-AND-TESTING.md#2-testing-strategy). |
| engineering:documentation | Engineering plugin, by Anthropic | 4 | Technical writing guidance: write for the reader, put the most useful information first, and link instead of duplicating. Applied while restructuring the architecture document and updating the others. |
| impeccable | Project skill in `.claude/skills/impeccable`, from Impeccable | 7 | Interface design: critique, audit, polish, and new screens from the project's product and design context. Its `init` command wrote [`PRODUCT.md`](PRODUCT.md). |
| commit | Project skill in `.claude/skills/commit` | 7 | Creates one descriptive commit per finished request, as `CLAUDE.md` asks. |
| adversarial-reviewer | Project subagent in `.claude/agents` | 7 | Reviews a finished pull request in a fresh context, with read-only tools, against its ticket and OpenSpec change, and tries to break it. Pull request #46 was its first use. |

## How the context was structured

- **Carrying context between sessions.** Each session ended with a full export of the conversation and a session summary: what was decided, the state of each document, the documentation rules, and the next steps. The next session started from the documents, the summary, and the exports.
- **Rules in every session.** The documentation rules and checks in [Rules and skills](#rules-and-skills) were restated at the start of each session through the summary.
- **Decisions stay with the product owner.** Claude proposes options with a recommendation; the product owner accepts, adjusts, or rejects each one. Decisions are recorded in the [PRD](docs/01-PRD.md#16-product-decisions) and the [architecture document](docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md#3-technical-decisions).
- **For the build.** Claude Code gets its context from `CLAUDE.md` and, for each ticket, from an OpenSpec change generated from the ticket and the documents it references, reviewed before implementation.

## Workflows

1. **Specification by questions.** Claude drafts, lists its assumptions and open questions, and the product owner answers them one by one ([§1, prompt 1](#1-product-overview) and [§5, prompt 2](#5-user-stories)).
2. **Second opinion.** A specification from another model is used only to find missing features, and Claude assesses each one before anything is added.
3. **Review and decide.** For each decision, Claude researches the current facts, proposes options with a recommendation, and updates every affected document in one pass once the product owner decides, followed by the automated checks.
4. **Documents to tracked work.** Epics, user stories, and work tickets are defined in the documents, and a script creates the GitHub issues from them, keeping each ticket linked to its stories ([§6, prompt 3](#6-work-tickets)).
5. **Spec-driven build (from delivery 2).** Work ticket → OpenSpec change → review → implementation with Claude Code → pull request that closes the ticket's issue.

## Manual adjustments

Examples of the AI's output that the product owner corrected or redirected:

- **Scope.** Replaced separate size and color fields with one Notes field, because they don't apply to medicine or food, and kept the first version focused on families and friends.
- **Terminology.** Replaced "household" with "group", because relatives who share a list may live in different homes.
- **Document hygiene.** Removed notes to the author and references to earlier versions, which became a standing rule.
- **Order of work.** Required a complete PRD, independent of any build framework, before anything was prepared for OpenSpec.
- **Release plan.** Reworked a plan built toward the full product into milestone 1, which delivers one workflow end to end, as the course requires.
- **Permissions.** Corrected a screen that offered buyers "Create a group", which buyers cannot do.
- **Architecture diagrams.** Asked for "mobile device" instead of "phone", a consistent rule for naming Next.js and React, and a subtitle for each C4 level.
- **Onboarding.** Questioned how the language was saved at sign-up, which led to showing the language on the last onboarding step, prefilled with the Welcome choice.
- **Planning.** Added the missing epic layer, the user stories each ticket implements, and the corrected course deadlines.
- **Readability.** Asked to split the data model diagram, which rendered too small to read, and to introduce and organize the data model and API sections of the readme.
- **Product description.** Rewrote the product summary, and chose one brand, ComproParaTi, over a separate English name.
- **Interface design.** Kept one responsive layout that reuses the mobile screens on desktop, instead of the desktop mockup Claude suggested, and renamed the People screen folders to `07-person-list` and `07-person-detail`.
- **Workflow tooling.** Kept the Impeccable engine binary and the Python cache out of git instead of using Git LFS. Extended the branch-protection hook to the GitHub MCP tools. Removed Bash from the reviewer subagent so it can only read. Replaced the adversarial-review skill with the subagent instead of keeping two reviewers. Required the type prefix from `CLAUDE.md` in ticket branch names.
- **Seed data and migrations.** Chose to add a former buyer and a cancelled invitation so the seed covers what the data model claims. Questioned the downside of a seed that never overwrites, which led to limiting its conflict handling to the primary key. Asked what a schema drift check would involve and added it to the ticket, and testing that plan showed that the first version of the check would have passed on a renamed column.

## 1. Product overview

**Prompt 1** (Part 1, message 1 · Claude Sonnet 5.5 · translated from Spanish)

> Take this information and generate a software specification:
>
> I want to build a web application that lets people who don't have access to online shopping find the products they want on websites and add those products to a list. Having the product URL is not required. People can also describe what they want to buy, for example sports shoes for Anthony. Sandals for Emily without a very high heel.
> Products can also be food or personal care items. The minimum required would be a name that identifies the item to buy.
>
> There can also be several lists, which can be organized into categories.
>
> The people who want to buy a product connect with people who have access to the products' websites and a credit card to buy and receive the products.
>
> The person who buys the products receives them and then, outside the platform, sends them to the person who requested them.
>
> On the platform it would be possible to track when the products have been shipped, and photos of the shipped products could also be documented.
>
> There are two profiles, the customer and the buyer.
>
> The customer is the one who wants to buy the products.
>
> The buyer is the one in charge of buying, receiving, and sending the products to the customer.
>
> It would be a web platform.
> Authentication would be with social accounts such as Gmail, Apple, Facebook, etc.
>
> It should support several languages, initially Spanish and English.
>
> Ideas of how it could work:
> The customer finds the product they want to add to their shopping list and copies the URL. The buyer clicks the link and adds the product to the shopping cart.
> Then the buyer would have to update the list to indicate that the products were already bought.
> This serves to communicate the status to the customer, and also so the buyer knows they don't need to buy it again.
>
> Customers must be able to define several people they want to buy products for, and customers can also invite other family members or friends to manage together the list of products they want to buy and who they are for.
>
> For example:
> A grandmother and her daughter can share the same shopping lists if they wish. Together they can define the list of people they want to buy for. It could be the grandfather, the grandson, the granddaughter, an aunt, a friend.
>
> For each of these people it should be possible to save preferences,
> such as clothing size, shoe size, preferred hair dye color.
>
> Buyers would associate products with these people they want to buy things for.
>
> When looking for products, the buyer will have access to the notes the customer wrote about each person, and so know what kind of product to look for.
> If the customer defined that they want sports shoes for Anthony, and the customer already defined that Anthony wears shoe size four, then the platform would automatically show that information to the buyer.

**Prompt 2** (Part 2, turn 3 · Claude Fable 5.1 · translated from Spanish)

> Now create a version of the documents for a simplified MVP. For example, size and color don't seem really necessary to me. Those attributes apply to clothing but not to other items such as medicine and food. A single Notes field per product could be enough.
>
> The first version of the product will be used by family and friends who know each other, and the goal is to make it simpler to buy things and ship them.

**Prompt 3** (Part 4, turn 9 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> Starting fro m the bottom:
>
> On the project name: IBuy4U vs ComproParaTi.  I agree to one brand, written as ComproParaTi (“I buy for you”).
>
> OpenSpec: Yes, record the build approach now as a decision in Architecture §3. I was thinking on giving the work tickets you generated to OpenSpec as the starting point to generate the spec and plan the actual implementation. Is this the right approach?
>
> The numbers you picked are fine with me. I agree with the 3 suggested changes .
>
> I'm in agreement with the technical decisions recommendations.
>
> I have feedback on the Product Summary section in the PRD. I think it should be more elaborated for a solid and professional project description. Here's an updated version below. What are your thoughts?
>
> Problem. Many people, often immigrants, buy products for relatives in countries where those products are hard to find or cannot be bought online. Requests arrive scattered across emails, phone calls, WhatsApp messages: sizes and preferences get lost, two relatives buy the same product, and nobody is sure what was bought, what was shipped, or how it was sent.
> Solution. A web application where a family keeps shared lists of what they need, along with each person’s sizes and preferences. The buyers they invite reserve items, buy them, and record each shipment, so everyone can see where each item stands, from the request to the shipment. Conversations stay on WhatsApp, one tap away from any item, while the vital information lives in one place. Payment and shipping happen outside the platform.
> Goal of the MVP: make simpler to buy products and ship them with custom lists and workflow for tracking.

### 1.3. Design and user experience

**Prompt 1** (Part 6, turn 2 · — · Claude Opus 5.5)

> I added the files to the folder design/stitch. Review them only and let me know what to do next.
> The folder `warm_utilitarian_care` contains the file DESIGN.md (Should the folder warm_utilitarian_care  be moved out of the stitch folder or renamed?)

**Prompt 2** (Part 6, turn 4 · — · Claude Opus 5.5)

> In the folder design/stitch you can find the folders exported from Stitch.
> The screenshots show mobile but on desktop the same concept will apply using a responsive design with the goal of reusing the same code and layouts.
>
> There are three folders that contain a design.md file, evaluate the content of those files against design/DESIGN.md and identify any updates from the files that need to be applied to design/DESIGN.md  in order to match the discrepancies you founde earlier.

**Prompt 3** (Part 6, turn 10 · — · Claude Opus 5.5)

> i restored the folder guided_setup_comproparati
>
> Explain how The docs contradict each other here.
> What are your recommendations to resolve the contradictions?

---

## 2. System architecture

### 2.1. Architecture diagram

**Prompt 1** (Part 4, turn 2 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> I accept your recommendation to switch to Better Auth.
> In regards the libraries, I agree with all your suggestions. Incorporate the libraries to the documentation so it is clear what are all the dependencies in the project.
>  sharp for thumbnails generation, ipaddr.js for the SSRF guard, ESLint and Prettier, shadcn/ui
>
> Update the docs to v1.4 in one pass and run the link, ID, Mermaid, and OpenAPI checks.
>
> Other Observations:
> In the Architecture.md file:
>
> 1.1 System context (C4 level 1)
>
> * In the diagram: "(phone and computer browser)". It is better to use mobile devices to reference all the devices variations that is not limited to phones.
> * When you reference the presentation layer "Pages, components", sometimes you mention Next.js and exclude React, and sometimes the other way around. Revise the criteria you used to select one way or the other and make sure they are used properly in the C4 diagrams.
> * The first subtitle in this section refers to C4 Level 1, but none of the other subtitles mentions the other levels. This is not consistent for the reader.

### 2.2. Description of main components

**Prompt 1** (Part 2, turn 8 · Claude Fable 5.1)

> *Attached: `ui-ux-design-simplified-mvp-v0.5.md`, `software-spec-simplified-mvp-v0.9.md`*
>
> Based on these specs and ui/ux documents, propose the technologies for Frontend, backend, database, hosting, email provider and login taking into account the solution must meet these criteria:
>
> * Other developers must be able to checkout the Github repo and be able to fully run it locally. Seed data will be needed.
> * Ease of deployment from Github. Managing infrastructure and ci/cd pipelines should not become a burden for the developers. Example: Vercel vs custom AWS infrastructure.
> * Operate infrastructure at the lowest cost possible

**Prompt 2** (Part 3, turn 4 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> Ok. Moving to Step 2: Approve the stack.
> We agree with the Proposed stack: Next.js with TypeScript, Postgres on Neon with Drizzle, Auth.js, Vercel for hosting and cron, and Resend for email.
> Decisions left open:
> Where thumbnails are stored (Vercel Blob or Postgres) <- What is your recommendation?
>
> Whether Neon's free-tier cold starts are acceptable. <- Yes, acceptable.
>
> I'd add one more to check. The 15-minute email batch (FR-36) needs a scheduler that runs every 15 minutes, and Vercel's free tier has historically limited cron frequency and commercial use. <- Verify this. We can change the 15 min spec if needed.

**Prompt 3** (Part 3, turn 5 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> I agree with the recommendation of storing thumbnails in Vercel Blob.
> Make sure you document the decision and why in the doc.
>
> No, the project is not commercial, through paid development, and we don't expect revenue at least initially.

### 2.3. High-level project description and file structure

**Prompt 1** (Part 3, turn 12 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> *Attached: `readme_en.md` (the project documentation deliverable template, with sections 0. Project sheet, 1. Product overview, 2. System architecture, 3. Data model, 4. API specification, 5. User stories, 6. Work tickets, and 7. Pull requests)*
>
> The PRD should also cover Business Rules, System architecture, Data Model, API specification.
> With the PRD document, we should be able to fill the majority of the sections in the attached .md file that serves as the first deliverable for the project corresponding to its documentation.
>
> Output: I want to keep the doc as a .md file.
>
> Decision needed: one document or three? I agree having multiple docs doesn't work well. I want the alternative that you proposed but keeping a single document. This is: we will have a single document with a short high level content for the main sections so whoever reads it gets a clear idea of what the project is without reading many pages -- what a Product person will actually deliver -- and then a detailed specifications section of the document that gets into the details of each of the sections.
>
> Thoughts on this approach?

**Prompt 2** (Part 3, turn 25 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> *Attached: screenshot of a repository with numbered documentation files, `example_PRD.md`, `example_readme.md`, `example-C4.drawio`*
>
> I was looking at examples of projects and how they organize the product and technical documentation. I see different trends:
> - separating the different sections we included in a single document, into single .md files. See image attached.
> - keep the information related to product in a PRD.md document, keeping a summary of the more technical sections there, like Architecture Summary, Data Model summary; and referencing their details to be found in separate related document(s). See the examples documents .md attached
>
> Your task: Analyze these approaches and provide your recommendations. I want to make any changes in the docs structure now before we get to the next steps.

**Prompt 3** (Part 3, turn 26 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> *Attached: two screenshots of an example README, `example_2_readme.md`*
>
> I approve this structure. The README can link into `docs/` but it has to cover all the sections requested in the project's template. The full text and the details doesn't have to live in the README itself, but it has to have enough information to satisfy the requested content. Here is an example attached.

### 2.4. Infrastructure and deployment

**Prompt 1** (Part 3, turn 6 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> before we move on, I have some questions:
>
> Would you consider using Make or Just in this project for easy setup and maintenance?
>
> Can the platforms you recommended also have Terraform providers that could be used to automate the configuration of the hosting and services?

**Prompt 2** (Part 3, turn 7 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> Yes. And I want to document these additional considerations and decisions made, for reference as things that were taken into account.

**Prompt 3** (Part 4, turn 8 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> I already enabled Issues for the repo.
> Use readme.md as the name in lowercase instead of uppercase.
>
> Let's finish the pending technical decisions to finalize the documentation before copying the content to my local repo and pushing to the upstream repo. Also, I will be pushing my local branch feature/entrega-1-OJE for the delivery, as indicated in the course:
>
> * D 1: `feature/entrega-1-OJE`
> * D 2: `feature/entrega-2-OJE`
> * D 3 final : `final-project-OJE`

### 2.5. Security

**Prompt 1** (Part 3, turn 9 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> I accept everything but these:
>
> 4 - A user's last group access ends, for example a buyer removed from their only group - They see "You're not in any group yet." with Create a group and a note to ask for an invitation.

### 2.6. Tests

**Prompt 1** (Part 4, turn 13 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> Do we have a testing strategy for this project as part of the documentation?
> If not, utilize the skill below to define one based on the project documentation we have so far. Remember this project needs to be able to run locally.
> If there is a strategy somewhere in the document, tell me where to review it, and also review it yourself using the skill below.

> Design test strategies and test plans.

**Prompt 2** (Part 7, turn 24 · — · Claude Opus 5.5)

> you mentioned to run lint after the  ticket is done, and the review commands ran. Is that done manually? Can it be automated? If so how?

**Prompt 3** (Part 10, turn 4 · T-02 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> You mentioned: 
> No CI check for schema drift: nothing automatically confirms the schema and migrations still match, since the ticket doesn't ask for it. If you want one, it's a small addition.
>
> Explain this addition

## 3. Data model

**Prompt 1** (Part 2, turn 12 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> Is there an address associated to groups? How would the buyer know who and where to ship the products that were bought?

**Prompt 2** (Part 2, turn 13 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> Add a short list of delivery addresses to each group.
> OK to leave the ID out.
>
> *Files updated: `software-spec-mvp-v1.0.md`, `ui-ux-design-mvp-v1.0.md`*

**Prompt 3** (Part 4, turn 3 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> Another observation:
> Better Auth settings
> `users.language` is set at sign-up from the language chosen on the Welcome screen. The column requires a value, but onboarding happens after the account exists.
>
> What do you mean by "but onboarding happens after the account exists."
>
> If you are telling me that the user has to chose a language during sing-up, that sets the property value. I don't understand your point.

## 4. API specification

**Prompt 1** (Part 3, turn 13 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> I agree with you. Each piece of information should be in the document once, and be referenced in other sections as needed. This reinforced the idea of one source of truth, that is also easier to maintain.
>
> Keep rules out of the overview. -- Agree.
> Some sections go beyond a typical PRD. -- Agree.
> Give business rules their own section. -- Agree.
>
> Decisions needed:
>
> 1. Yes, I agree with your recommendation.
> 2. yes, as I mentioned above.
> 3. I agree with your proposal for Success metrics

**Prompt 2** (Part 13, turn 2 · T-03 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> 1)  moving AC-95 to T-10
> 2) install it
> 3) Follow your recommendation

**Prompt 3** (Part 14, turn 1 · T-07 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> Work on T-07 and then T-09 end to end while I sleep, without waiting for me at
> any point. For these two tickets I explicitly authorize these overrides of
> CLAUDE.md and openspec/config.yaml:
>
> 1. Proposal approval: after /opsx:propose, review the proposal yourself and
>    continue to /commit and /opsx:apply without waiting.
> 2. Gaps or conflicts in the docs: don't ask me. Choose the option you would
>    recommend and update the document that owns the fact first, in the same PR,
>    following the documentation rules. Technical choices go in design.md as
>    usual.
> 3. Dependencies: if a package outside Architecture §1.6 is really required,
>    install it and add it to Architecture §1.6 in the same PR. Prefer existing
>    dependencies whenever they are enough.
> 4. Opening the PR: when every task is done and lint, tsc and tests pass, open
>    the PR, run the adversarial-reviewer, post its findings, fix what's
>    warranted, and re-review once.
> 5. Merge readiness: assume each PR is ready to merge once step 4 is done, and
>    run step 5 (archive, point the OpenSpec link to the archived change, AI usage
>    record, commit, push) without waiting for me. Record T-07 as one part and
>    T-09 as the next part, noting that it continues the same session.
> 6. T-09 branching: after T-07's step 5, create feat/t-09-lists-items-api from
>    feat/t-07-groups-api (not from main) and open its PR with
>    --base feat/t-07-groups-api. Follow the same flow for T-09.
>
> Don't record the decisions you made on my behalf anywhere in the repository.
> Still never merge, force-push, or commit to protected branches. If something
> truly blocks a ticket, stop and explain.
>
> When you finish, reply with: both PR URLs, the merge order, one line per
> unresolved review finding, and a summary of every decision you made under
> items 1–3 for each ticket (what was open, what you chose, why, and which
> document you changed), so I can check them before merging.

## 5. User stories

**Prompt 1** (Part 3, turn 8 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> ok, let's move to Step 3.
>
> Add acceptance criteria for errors and permissions. There are 24 criteria for 38 requirements, and nearly all of them cover the happy path. Missing cases include a removed buyer trying to reserve, an already-used invitation, editing a reserved item, emails that should skip the user's own changes, and account deletion.
>
> What do you need from me to complete this step?

**Prompt 2** (Part 3, turn 2 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> ok. Let's take care of Next steps 1: Answer the questions.
>
> 1. Agree with your suggestion : edits keep the reservation and show the buyer an "Updated" marker. Deleting is blocked while the item is reserved.
> 2. Agree: the item's buyer can undo the last step and edit shipment details.
> 3. Archived lists: yes, all items from archived lists disappear from everywhere. Yes, lists can be renamed or deleted.
> 4. Agree with your suggestion: block it while the recipient has unshipped items. Otherwise, the items keep the recipient's name.
> 5. I accept both suggestions: same rule applies to members and buyers. the owner transfers ownership before they leaves, and if they're the only member, the group is deleted.
> 6. single use.
> 7. confirmed.
> 8. Any member can invite buyers.
> 9. Yes, the WhatsApp number is required and the empty state is dropped.
> 10. Accept Suggestion: reservations are released, unshipped purchases return to Pending, and history shows "Former user."
> 11. Countries will members and buyers be in: Cuba, US, Central and South America. Keep the requirement for now. We will find alternatives and investigate further if these access restrictions apply.
> 12. Go with the Suggestion: refresh-based. Adding an explicit refresh button to the UI would be my recommendation for better UX.
> 13. Go with the Suggestion: stay signed in for 30 days

**Prompt 3** (Part 4, turn 6 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> Before we continue with the technical decisions, let's correct the deadlines for Milestone 1 the project: Core cycle end to end.
>
> D1 Oct 22
> D2 Nov 19
> D3 Dec 6
>
> Also, we need a tool for User-Story/Task tracking. I decided we are going to use GitHub Issues. Document this in the project. You can check out more details here: [GitHub Issues Feature Page](https://github.com/features/issues),  [GitHub About Issues Documentation](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-issues). An important requirement for the project is that the tickets exist and are referenced in the documentation. Using this tool has the advantage that the Kanban board lives in the same repository.
>
> ```
> User stories vs. work tickets: the difference
> It is a common point of confusion. The distinction is simple:
>
> User story → a description in business language of what the user needs to do. Example: "As a fleet manager, I want to see the status of all my vehicles on a dashboard to make quick operational decisions." It is for everyone, including the client.
>
> Work ticket → a technical definition of the task to be executed. What needs to be done, how it is implemented, and acceptance criteria. It is for the developer.
>
> A single user story can generate multiple tickets. Tickets are what actually go into  the Kanban board.
> ```
>
> You  have already created the user stories(US)  and Work Tickets(T) for milestone 1, based on the delivery plan we've been working on. A missing element we have in the planning phase is we are missing the Epics. Identify the Epics based on the US and T you already created. This is important because it gives an additional layer of abstraction in the PRD and inform also the decisions made as far as prioritization of the functionalities selected for the MVP and each milestone.
>
> An issue I found in the documentation we have so far: I do not see the reference to the US numbers in the Tickets table.  We will be setting up Github Issues for this project, and putting together and creating the stories and tasks within this tool. It is important that we keep the reference between US and T.
>
> Ask me any questions you may have to continue

## 6. Work tickets

**Prompt 1** (Part 3, turn 33 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> The product increments in the release plan make sense. However, the final deliverable for the course requires a fully functional workflow end-to-end in the application. This means that we have to have at least one of the workflows completed. This release plan is towards a fully functional product.

**Prompt 2** (Part 3, turn 34 · Claude Opus 5.5 · translated from Spanish)

> Delivery 1: Technical documentation
> Deadline: Thursday, October 22, end of day.
> Includes:
> * Project sheet: name, description, repository URL or ZIP
> * Product overview: objective, features, functionality
> * System architecture and data model
> * User stories and work tickets
> * Chosen technology stack
> Does NOT include code yet. This delivery is 100% documentation.
>
> Delivery 2: Working code
> Deadline: Friday, November 20, end of day.
> Includes:
> * Scaffolds of your architecture (front end, back end, and database already connected)
> * The main flow almost complete
> * First working features
>
> Delivery 3: Final delivery
> Deadline: Wednesday, December 9, end of day.
> Includes:
> * Deliveries 1 and 2 combined
> * Between 3 and 5 complete, working product features
> * Test suite (unit, integration, at least one end-to-end test of the main flow)
> * Deployment evidence: public URL, screenshots, or video of the system working
> * A complete `prompts.md` file (or equivalent record of AI usage)

**Prompt 3** (Part 4, turn 7 · Claude Opus 5.5)

> We don't really have to track the Epics in Github Issues. We can keep it simple so we use what is available out of the box. Adjust your plan based on that.
>
> Q1. What is the scenario for a ticket that serve several stories? Work Tickets typically don't span several user stories. Is the other way around because stories are created first: A single user story can generate multiple work tickets. I will go with your recommendation here.
>
> Q2. Yes. I agree
>
> Q3. I will go with your recommendation: create all 26 US, with tasks only for milestone 1.
>
> Q4. ok. I agree
>
> Q5. This is the repo: https://github.com/ojordan0/AI4Devs-finalproject. There is no Github Projects created for it. We can setup the GitHub connector for this session.
>
> Q6. Epics are fine.
>
> We can define Milestone 2: Complete MVP  deadline for Dec 31 to show the complete plan.
>
> After the plan and documentation is complete, the next step will be to put all the files in the repo, complete the first delivery: technical documentation, and then incorporate OpnSpec to the project. Then, using the SDD workflow, for each work ticket: generate the specs and proceed with the implementation.

## 7. Pull requests

**Prompt 1** (Part 5, turn 11 · — · Claude Opus 5.5)

> push the changes to the repo, create a PR to merge this branch to main, and then it can be deleoted. Then, let's end this session so you can write the export and update the prompts.md

**Prompt 2** (Part 7, turn 11 · — · Claude Opus 5.5)

> Create a Claude Code hook that enforces the branch rules in CLAUDE.md, so they don't depend on Claude remembering them.
>
> **What it must block** (PreToolUse hook on the Bash tool):
> 1. `git commit` when the current branch is protected. Protected branches: `main`, `feature/entrega-1-OJE`, `feature/entrega-2-OJE`, `final-project-OJE`.
> 2. `git push` that targets `main` directly (e.g. `git push`, `git push origin main`, `git push origin HEAD:main` while on main). Changes reach `main` only through merged PRs.
> 3. Any force push (`--force`, `-f`, `--force-with-lease`, `+refspec`) to any branch.
>
> **What it must allow:**
> - Commits and pushes on ticket branches (`t-NN-*`).
> - The delivery push: `git push origin main:<delivery-branch>` for the three delivery branches, without force. CLAUDE.md governs when that happens; the hook only makes sure it's a fast-forward push.
>
> **Requirements:**
> - First, check the Claude Code documentation for the current hook configuration format, the JSON the hook receives on stdin, and how a hook blocks a tool call and returns a reason to Claude. Follow that, not assumptions.
> - Put the configuration in the project's `.claude/settings.json` (shared, committed) and the script in `.claude/hooks/`. Keep the list of protected branches in one place at the top of the script.
> - Handle realistic command shapes: chained commands (`git add . && git commit -m ...`), `git -C <path> commit`, leading `cd <dir> &&`, and commit messages that merely contain the word "main" or "push" (those must not trigger a block).
> - When blocking, give a clear reason that tells Claude what to do instead (e.g. "You're on main; create a ticket branch first, see CLAUDE.md").
> - Use only tools that are already available in this environment; check before depending on `jq` or similar.
> - If the hook itself fails unexpectedly (e.g. can't determine the branch), it should block with an explanation rather than silently allow.
>
> **Testing:** before finishing, test the script directly by piping sample hook input JSON into it, covering each block and allow case above, including the edge cases. Show me a table of test case → expected → actual.
>
> **Git:** this isn't tied to a ticket. Follow the CLAUDE.md rules otherwise: branch off an updated `main` as `chore/branch-protection-hook`, commit with `/commit`, and wait for me before opening the PR.
>
> Finally, list any cases the hook can't reliably catch.

**Prompt 3** (Part 7, turn 20 · — · Claude Opus 5.5)

> Now I have a subagent reviewer, and also a skill reviewer. They seem redundant to me. The subagent looks like the right choice for a reviewer. A subagent runs in its own fresh context. It sees only the PR and the code, which is what we want for the final review.
>
> Compare both, based on what they do and where the review runs.
> Evaluate these aproaches and tell me which one is better in this case to avoid redundancy:
>
> 1- Make the skill the checklist the subagent uses. Keep what to check in the skill and have the subagent load it through the skills field in its frontmatter (skills: \<skill-name>). The agent file then shrinks to role, rules and output format. This is worth it if we’d also run that checklist by hand, outside the PR flow.
>
> 2- Give it a different job. For example, a quick self-check you run with /\<skill-name> before committing, to catch obvious problems early. It complements the final adversarial review rather than duplicating it. If you go this way, give it a description that makes clear when to use it, so Claude doesn’t pick it instead of the subagent at PR time.
