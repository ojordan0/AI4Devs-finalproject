# Spec Delta

## Purpose

Checks every pull request automatically and keeps `main` from receiving code that fails those checks, so problems surface before a merge and not in production.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Checks run on every pull request

Every pull request into `main` SHALL run the checks in Infrastructure §3 step 2, each reported as its own named check, whichever files the pull request changes. The OpenAPI check is added by T-03, when the generator exists.

#### Scenario: A pull request shows all checks

- **WHEN** a pull request into `main` is opened or updated
- **THEN** it shows a separate result for linting, type checks, unit and integration tests with coverage, browser tests, the documentation link check, and the dependency audit

#### Scenario: A documentation-only pull request is still checked

- **WHEN** a pull request changes only Markdown files
- **THEN** every check still runs and reports a result, so required checks never stay pending

### Requirement: CI matches local commands

CI SHALL run the same commands as a developer's machine, as Security and testing §2.5 describes, using a Postgres service container in place of Docker Compose and only placeholder credentials.

#### Scenario: Integration tests run against the service container

- **WHEN** the tests with coverage run in CI
- **THEN** they connect to a `comproparati_test` database in a Postgres service container, with no repository secrets

#### Scenario: Browser tests run against a production build

- **WHEN** the browser tests run in CI
- **THEN** they run in Chromium and WebKit against a production build on localhost
- **AND** a failed test is retried once, and the report lists every retried test

#### Scenario: A failing check fails the pull request

- **GIVEN** a pull request where a lint rule, a type check, a test, or the coverage target fails
- **WHEN** the checks finish
- **THEN** the matching check is reported as failed

### Requirement: Documentation link check

A documentation link check SHALL fail when a link in the project's Markdown documents points to a file or heading anchor that doesn't exist in the repository. It SHALL run without network access. Exported session records are excluded, because they are verbatim history.

#### Scenario: Valid links pass

- **WHEN** the check runs on documents whose repository links and anchors all resolve
- **THEN** it passes

#### Scenario: A broken file link fails

- **GIVEN** a document that links to a file that doesn't exist
- **WHEN** the check runs
- **THEN** it fails and names the document and the link

#### Scenario: A broken anchor fails

- **GIVEN** a document that links to a heading that doesn't exist in an existing file
- **WHEN** the check runs
- **THEN** it fails and names the document and the link

#### Scenario: External links are not requested

- **GIVEN** a document with a link to an outside website
- **WHEN** the check runs
- **THEN** the link is skipped and no network request is made

### Requirement: Dependency audit

Every pull request SHALL run a dependency audit, as Security and testing §1 requires, that fails on a known high or critical vulnerability.

#### Scenario: A vulnerable dependency fails the build

- **GIVEN** an installed package with a known high or critical vulnerability
- **WHEN** the audit runs
- **THEN** the audit check fails and names the package

### Requirement: Automated dependency updates

The repository SHALL open dependency update pull requests automatically, as Security and testing §1 requires, for npm packages and GitHub Actions.

#### Scenario: Updates are proposed on a schedule

- **WHEN** a newer version of a dependency is available at the weekly check
- **THEN** a pull request proposing the update is opened against `main`, and it runs the same checks as any other pull request

### Requirement: Merging into main is protected

`main` SHALL accept changes only through a pull request whose required checks pass, with no bypass for administrators, as Infrastructure §3 step 3 describes. Approvals are not required; the adversarial review stays a required step of the pull request process in CLAUDE.md.

#### Scenario: A failing pull request can't be merged

- **GIVEN** a pull request with a failed required check
- **WHEN** anyone, including the repository owner, tries to merge it
- **THEN** GitHub refuses the merge

#### Scenario: A passing pull request can be merged without an approval

- **GIVEN** a pull request whose required checks pass, up to date with `main`, opened by the only collaborator
- **WHEN** the owner merges it
- **THEN** GitHub allows the merge

#### Scenario: A direct push is refused

- **WHEN** anyone pushes directly to `main`
- **THEN** GitHub refuses the push

#### Scenario: Force pushes and deletion are refused

- **WHEN** anyone force-pushes to `main` or tries to delete it
- **THEN** GitHub refuses the request
