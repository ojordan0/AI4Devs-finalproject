# developer-environment Specification

## Purpose
Lets any developer go from a fresh clone to a running, tested app with one setup command, using only Node.js and Docker, and with no accounts on outside services.

## Requirements

### Requirement: One-command setup

`npm run setup` SHALL prepare a fresh clone for development and testing, needing only Node.js and Docker, as described in Security and testing §2.5 and the local setup requirement in PRD §15.

#### Scenario: Fresh clone is set up

- **GIVEN** a fresh clone, with Node.js and Docker available
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run setup`
- **THEN** the command finishes without errors
- **AND** dependencies are installed, Postgres is running, the development and test databases exist, migrations and seed data have been applied, and the Chromium and WebKit browsers are installed

#### Scenario: Environment file is created once

- **GIVEN** a clone with no `.env` file
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run setup`
- **THEN** `.env` is created from `.env.example`
- **AND** running the command again leaves an edited `.env` unchanged

#### Scenario: Setup can run again

- **GIVEN** a clone where `npm run setup` has already succeeded
- **WHEN** the developer runs it again
- **THEN** it finishes without errors and without losing data in the development database

#### Scenario: A prerequisite is missing

- **GIVEN** a machine where Docker isn't running, Docker Compose isn't available, or Node.js is older than the version the project requires
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run setup`
- **THEN** the command stops with a message naming the missing prerequisite

### Requirement: Configuration template

The repository SHALL include an `.env.example` listing every variable in Infrastructure §7, with values that work locally or are clearly placeholders, and SHALL never track a real secret or a developer's `.env`.

#### Scenario: Every variable is listed

- **WHEN** `.env.example` is compared with the variables in Infrastructure §7
- **THEN** each variable appears in the file

#### Scenario: The environment file stays out of Git

- **GIVEN** a clone with a `.env` file
- **WHEN** the developer checks the working tree's status
- **THEN** Git ignores `.env`

### Requirement: Running the app locally

`npm run dev` SHALL start the app on localhost after setup, without credentials for any outside service.

#### Scenario: The app runs in development

- **GIVEN** a clone where `npm run setup` has succeeded, with `.env` unchanged
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run dev` and opens the local address
- **THEN** Welcome loads without errors, with the development sign-in, and signing in as a seed user works without Google credentials

### Requirement: Test commands

The test commands SHALL each do what Security and testing §2.5 describes, and each level SHALL include at least one passing example test.

#### Scenario: Default tests pass

- **GIVEN** the local Postgres is running
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm test`
- **THEN** the unit and integration tests run and pass

#### Scenario: Unit tests need nothing else

- **GIVEN** Postgres isn't running
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run test:unit`
- **THEN** the unit tests run and pass

#### Scenario: Integration tests use the test database

- **GIVEN** the local Postgres is running
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run test:integration`
- **THEN** the tests connect to `comproparati_test`, as Security and testing §2.3 requires, and the development database isn't touched

#### Scenario: Integration tests refuse a remote database

- **GIVEN** `DATABASE_URL` points to a host other than the local machine, where the CI service container also runs, in its host or through a connection parameter
- **WHEN** the integration tests start
- **THEN** they stop with an error before connecting

#### Scenario: Browser tests pass in both browsers

- **GIVEN** the local Postgres is running
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run test:e2e`
- **THEN** the app is built and started on localhost, and the example test passes in Chromium on a phone-size screen and in WebKit on an iPhone-size screen
- **AND** the example test reports no automated accessibility violations

#### Scenario: Coverage report is produced

- **GIVEN** the local Postgres is running
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run test:coverage`
- **THEN** a line coverage report for the domain services is produced, and the command fails if coverage is below the target in Security and testing §2.6

### Requirement: Code quality commands

`npm run lint` SHALL fail when the code breaks an ESLint rule, including the accessibility rules in Architecture §1.6, or isn't formatted by Prettier. TypeScript SHALL run in strict mode.

#### Scenario: Clean code passes

- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` on the scaffold
- **THEN** both finish without errors

#### Scenario: A lint violation fails

- **GIVEN** a source file that breaks an ESLint rule
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run lint`
- **THEN** the command fails and names the file and rule

#### Scenario: Unformatted code fails

- **GIVEN** a source file that Prettier would change
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run lint`
- **THEN** the command fails and names the file

#### Scenario: A type error fails

- **GIVEN** a source file with an implicit `any`
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **THEN** the command fails and names the file

### Requirement: Database commands

`npm run db:migrate` SHALL apply every migration to the local database, and `npm run db:seed` SHALL load the seed data, so that `npm run setup` creates the database from scratch with seed data.

#### Scenario: Setup creates the database from scratch

- **GIVEN** a fresh clone and a Postgres volume with no data
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run setup`
- **THEN** the development database has every table and the seed data

#### Scenario: Commands succeed with nothing to apply

- **GIVEN** a local database where both commands have already succeeded
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run db:migrate` and then `npm run db:seed`
- **THEN** both finish without errors and change nothing

### Requirement: Pages take their text from the translation files

Every page SHALL take all its visible text and its title from the translation files, in the language chosen for the request, following FR-37. T-04 sets up translations for pages; T-05 adds date and number formatting (FR-38).

#### Scenario: Page text comes from the message files

- **WHEN** Welcome is rendered for a browser that prefers Spanish
- **THEN** its visible text and title match the entries in the Spanish message file, and the document language is Spanish

#### Scenario: T-04 the message files have the same keys

- **WHEN** the Spanish and English message files are compared
- **THEN** they have the same keys and no empty message
- Verified by the existing unit test.

### Requirement: Tests start from freshly seeded data

Each integration test file and each browser test run SHALL start with the test database emptied and the seed loaded again, as Security and testing §2.3 requires. Emptying SHALL only ever reach the test database.

#### Scenario: Integration test files don't see each other's data

- **GIVEN** an integration test file that adds and changes rows
- **WHEN** the next integration test file starts
- **THEN** the database holds exactly the seed data

#### Scenario: Browser test runs don't see earlier data

- **GIVEN** a test database with rows left by an earlier test run
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm run test:e2e`
- **THEN** the app starts against a database holding exactly the seed data

#### Scenario: Development data is never emptied

- **GIVEN** a development database with data, and `DATABASE_URL` pointing to it
- **WHEN** the developer runs `npm test` or `npm run test:e2e`
- **THEN** the development database is unchanged
